About Fuzzy Cognitive Maps
  A cognitive map may be defined as "an overall mental image or representation of the space and layout of a setting", which means
that the act of cognitive mapping is "the mental structuring process leading to the creation of a cognitive map".

  A Fuzzy cognitive map is a cognitive map within which the relations between the elements (e.g. concepts, events, project 
resources) of a "mental landscape" can be used to compute the "strength of impact" of these elements. The theory behind that
computation is fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is exact opposite of binary logic where everything can be defined in terms of Yes or No.
On the contrary, fuzzy logic tells us that relationships can have intermediate values as well, instead of just 0 and 1. 

  This javascript library will enable users to draw, save and export cognitive maps in browser based applications.The library
can be easily integrated in any web applications as it consumes and produces structured data in json format.
